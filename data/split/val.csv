Peripheral retinal thinning is most often related to a condition called lattice degeneration. This is present in 8 to 10 percent of the population and can be present for many years. Lattice degeneration does increase the risk of a retinal tear or retinal detachment.

Query: is it compulsory to have implantation bleeding during pregnancy
Passage 1: Implantation Bleeding. After ovulation the egg travels into the uterus and burrows into the lining of the uterus. For some women implantation will cause slight bleeding or spotting. This is called implantation bleeding. This is sometimes confused for an early period.
Passage 2: Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is any discharge of blood from the vagina. It can happen any time from conception (when the egg is fertilized) to the end of pregnancy. Light bleeding, or spotting, during pregnancy is common, especially during the first trimester. Usually this is no cause for alarm. It is considered spotting when you notice a few drops of blood occasionally in your underwear. There is not even enough blood to cover a panty liner. Bleeding is a heavier flow of blood.
Passage 3: Definition of Homo sapiens in the AudioEnglish.org Dictionary. Meaning of Homo sapiens. What does Homo sapiens mean? Proper usage and pronunciation (in phonetic transcription) of the word Homo sapiens. Information about Homo sapiens in the AudioEnglish.org dictionary, synonyms and antonyms.
Passage 4: Implantation bleeding is fairly common with pregnancy. Twenty to thirty percent of women will have spotting during early pregnancy. If you have some light spotting before your period would normally start this is not something to worry about and may be a sign of pregnancy.
Passage 5: Food insecurity currently affects nearly 50 million people nationwide – most frequently, families with children. A recent Food Research & Action Center study revealed that as of April 2015, one in six households reported the inability to afford food.

Query: warfarin causing bleeding gums
Passage 1: Certain health problems increase the INR and the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and may cause bleeding. For example, sick patients with poor nutrition often become vitamin K deficient, which increases the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and the risk of bleeding.
Passage 2: Blood thinners like warfarin (Coumadin) can make you bleed more easily -- including from your gums. Some anti-seizure, blood pressure, and immune-suppressing drugs make the gums grow too quickly. The new gum tissue is more delicate and may bleed when you brush it.
Passage 3: The smaller vascular. bundles of the outer ring (first five) are located at the angles of the stem; the larger bundles. (remaining five) form the inner ring. Shoot. The main stem of the cucumber plant begins growing erect but soon after assumes a. prostrate trailing habit and grows like a vine over the ground.
Passage 4: You've Got Gum Disease. If you see red when you brush, a likely cause is early-stage gum disease, or gingivitis. The bacteria that normally live in your mouth build up and form a sticky film on your teeth, called plaque. When you don't remove it by brushing well, it can make your gums swell up, turn red, and bleed.
Passage 5: Types of Ownership. Depending on the type of ownership the deed cites, you and your brother may not be equal owners of the home. If you took title as tenants in common, one of you may own 75 percent of the home and the other may own 25 percent. Ownership interests do not have to be legal with this type of deed.

Passage 3: Ducks and turkeys with a niacin deficiency show a severe bowing of the legs and an enlargement of the hock joint. The main difference between the leg seen in niacin deficiency and perosis as seen in manganese and choline deficiency is that with niacin deficiency the Achilles tendon seldom slips from its condyles.n the niacin-deficient hen, weight loss, reduced egg production, and a marked decrease in hatchability can result. Turkeys, ducks, pheasants, and goslings are much more severely affected by niacin deficiency than are chickens.
Passage 4: The signs of niacin deficiency related to leg problems are enlarged hock joints and slipped tendons (called perosis) so the leg splays out. We do know that ducks have a higher requirement for niacin than chickens. NRC requirements for ducklings = 55 mg/kg niacin compared to only 27-35 mg/kg for chicks.On top of that, the niacin in corn has a very low bioavailability; although corn contains 24 mg/kg of niacin, I use a value of 2 mg/kg for formulation.ypically the pills contain 500 mgs of niacin per tablet. Assuming a duck is eating about .35 lbs per day (this is how much a Pekin is eating at about 3 -4 weeks of age) , they need 10 milligrams (mgs) of niacin a day. So, theoretically, one pill has enough niacin for 50 ducks.

Query: waht is the main food energy molecule for all cells in the body
Passage 1: In fact, the Sun is the ultimate source of energy for almost all cells, because photosynthetic prokaryotes, algae, and plant cells harness solar energy and use it to make the complex organic food molecules that other cells rely on for the energy required to sustain growth, metabolism, and reproduction (Figure 1).denosine 5'-triphosphate, or ATP, is the most abundant energy carrier molecule in cells. This molecule is made of a nitrogen base (adenine), a ribose sugar, and three phosphate groups. The word adenosine refers to the adenine plus the ribose sugar.
Passage 2: All cells must have energy to function. Glucose and other sugars are cell food—they are the power source for cell activities in almost all living things. When glucose is stored as glycogen or taken in as starch, it must be broken down into individual sugar molecules before cells are able to use it.hen a sugar molecule is broken down, a usable form of energy is released for the cell's life functions. Cells can release energy in two basic processes: cellular respiration and fermentation. Cellular respiration requires oxygen, but fermentation does not.
Passage 3: Glucose is the Primary Source of Energy for Cells. Glucose is the human body's key source of energy as it provides energy to all the cells in our body.

Passage 1: 2. peripheral nervous system (PNS) - nerves extending toward or away from CNS and ganglia (aggregations of nerve cell bodies outside CNS). Nervous tissue consists of two major types of cells, 1. neurons-responsible for conduction, propagation, and reception of nervous impulses. Processes called axons or dendrites extend from these cells. 2. glial cells - (neuroglia) cells associated with neurons. No axons or dendrites. These cells are involved in nutrition, support, insulation, protection of neurons. If brain or spinal cord are sectioned, we find that two major areas of brain tissue may be defined on the basis of their color in fixed, unstained tissue.

Query: what causes the hiccups in your sleep
Passage 1: A number of diseases may cause hiccups that can occur at any time of the day, including during sleep. Hiccups may occur with many brain disorders, including strokes, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease or brain injuries.
Passage 2: A large number of medications may cause hiccups. Medications taken only at bedtime, such as sleep medicine, cause hiccups primarily during sleep. Other medications cause hiccups at other times of the day as well. These are examples of medications that may produce hiccups: Sleep medications: eszopiclone (Lunesta)
Passage 3: A hiccup is an involuntary contraction (myoclonic jerk) of the diaphragm that may repeat several times per minute. In Latin it is called singultus for the act of catching one's breath while sobbing. The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc. Once triggered, the reflex causes a strong contraction of the diaphragm followed about 0.25 second later by closure of the vocal cords, which results in the classic hic sound. Hiccups may occur individually, or they may occur in bouts. The rhythm of the hiccup, or the time between hiccups, tends to be relatively constant. A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies are often used to attempt to shorten the duration.
Passage 4: Drinking a large amount of carbonated drinks at bedtime can also cause hiccups, as the air in these drinks can distend the stomach. Consuming a large amount of alcohol before going to bed is another possible cause of hiccups during sleep. The excessive amount of alcohol can cause the stomach to distend.
