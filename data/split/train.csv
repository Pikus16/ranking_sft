Choke tubes typically come in cylinder, improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, full and extra full.A cylinder choke tube produces a very wide shot dispersion, whereas a extra full choke tube will provide a much tighter shot pattern. Different chokes are used for skeet, trap, and sporting clays.hoke tube selection is a confusing issue amongst a lot of shotgunners but one that is easily explained. Everyone knows how to pattern a shotgun and what they are looking for, which is the ultimate full choke pattern at 40 yards, which is a 70% shot pattern, it is this area where it all gets fuzzy and needs explaining.
Passage 2: Step 1. Check your passport. U.S. citizens will need a passport valid for at least six months after their planned departure date from Roatan. You will not need a visa to enter the country; you'll need to have only return airline tickets or some other proof of departure from Honduras at a future date.
Passage 3: In firearms, a choke is a tapered constriction of a shotgun barrel's bore at the muzzle end.Chokes are almost always used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance. Their purpose is to shape the spread of the shot in order to gain better range and accuracy.n the case of choke tubes, the amount of choke for each barrel is usually stamped on the side of the choke tube, or there may be thin slots cut in the exposed rim of the tube at the barrel opening with the number of slots corresponding to the number of *'s in this table.
Passage 4: Alpha hemolysis is caused by hydrogen peroxide produced by the bacterium, oxidizing hemoglobin producing the green oxidized derivative methemoglobin. Beta Beta hemolysis (β-hemolysis), sometimes called complete hemolysis, is a complete lysis of red cells in the media around and under the colonies: the area appears lightened (yellow) and transparent.
Passage 5: A choke tube also determines to some extent the shotgun's effective range. The tighter the constriction of the tube, the farther the range. For example, a full choke is most effective at 40 to 50 yards; an improved cylinder is most effective from 20 to 35 yards.efore the invention of choke, all barrels were simply straight tubes with an effective killing range of about 25 to 30 yards. Hits beyond that distance were a matter of luck.

Query: causes and effects of rheumatoid arthritis
Passage 1: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body.
Passage 2: The specific cause of rheumatoid arthritis has yet to be identified despite decades of medical research. While we don’t know specifically what causes rheumatoid arthritis, we do know that it is the result of an autoimmune disorder. An autoimmune disorder occurs when immune cells begin to attack the body. In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, the body attacks its own healthy joint tissue called the synovium.
Passage 3: While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule.
Passage 4: Fast Facts. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common type of autoimmune arthritis. It is caused when the immune system (the body’s defense system) is not working properly. RA causes pain and swelling in the wrist and small joints of the hand and feet. Treatments for RA can stop joint pain and swelling.
Passage 5: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic joint disease that damages the joints of the body. It is also a systemic disease that potentially affects internal organs of the body and leads to disability. The joint damage is caused by inflammation of the joint lining tissue. Inflammation is normally a response by the body's immune system to assaults such as infections, wounds, and foreign objects. In rheumatoid arthritis, the inflammation is misdirected to attack the joints.

PET plastic or glass spray bottle (PET plastic is the only kind of plastic that is safe to use with essential oils) 2  2 Tbsp. witch hazel (you can substitute vodka but it has a more prominent scent to it than witch hazel does and is much more drying to the skin)
Passage 2: Whether you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes or simply monitor your blood sugar levels to track your health, fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels are frequently measured. Since your fasting blood sugar is taken before eating a meal and your postprandial blood sugar is taken after the meal, your fasting level should be lower than your postprandial level. But if the numbers are reversed and your fasting blood sugar levels are higher than your postprandial levels, it could indicate a serious health problem. Know the Norms The American Diabetes Association, or ADA, recommends specific pre-meal and post-meal blood sugar ranges for healthy adults. According to the ADA, fasting blood sugar should fall between 70 to 130 milligrams per deciliter of blood. After you eat, this number should increase as your body absorbs sugar molecules from food. However, the ADA recommends that the postprandial blood glucose level stays at or below 180 milligrams per deciliter.
Passage 3: A: 293 would still constitute a diagnosis of diabetes, since it is over 200 - the limit for a random blood sugar, even without fasting.

An Oral Glucose Tolerance test may also be order to see how the blood sugars go over the course of 3 hours after a high carb load.

A reaction between an acid and base is called neutralisation. This neutralisation makes the stomach contents less corrosive.
Passage 2: The opposite of an acid is a base, and that's exactly what an antacid is. Antacids make you feel better by increasing the pH balance in your stomach. The pH system is a scale for measuring the acidity or alkalinity of a given environment (in this case, your stomach). The scale goes from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral. Below 7 is acid. Above 7 is alkaline.

Passage 2: Persons with sleep apnea actually stop breathing for brief periods of time (usually 10-20 seconds) while asleep. The pauses in breathing can be very frequent and occur 30 times or more per hour. The most common kind of sleep apnea is termed obstructive sleep apnea. In this case, the muscles in the throat relax to the extent that the airway is constricted or closed during inspiration (while breathing in). Breathing then stops briefly, resulting in lowered oxygen levels in the blood.
Passage 3: One of the most common symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea is loud snoring, a noise that occurs when air cannot move through the nose, mouth, and throat smoothly. The amount of snoring does not necessarily correlate with the level of sleep apnea - your condition might actually be more severe if you snore quietly.
Passage 4: People with sleep apnea often wake up suddenly due to shortness of breath. Upon waking, they may also choke, snort, or gasp. You may not even be aware of some of these symptoms while you sleep, but waking up feeling out of breath is a strong indicator that you have sleep apnea.

Query: how many calories are in mac n cheese
Passage 1: There are two types of double-hull ballast arrangements: 1  The first is the “L” type arrangement, where the ballast is the space between the outer and inner hulls.

This can lead to instability and in rough seas potentially to capsize. The second type of double-hull tanker is the U type, in which the ballast is one continuous divider between the outer and inner hulls.

Some genes enable cells to make proteins needed for basic functions; dubbed housekeeping genes, they are active in many types of cells. Other genes, however, are inactive most of the time. Some genes play a role in early development of the embryo and are then shut down forever. Many genes encode proteins that are unique to a particular kind of cell and that give the cell its character - making a brain cell, say, different from a bone cell.

Query: what cause vehicle steering wheel to shake when braking
Passage 1: The scope of work is the first step in any appraisal process. Without a strictly defined scope of work, an appraisal's conclusions may not be viable. By defining the scope of work, an appraiser can properly develop a value for a given property for the intended user, and for the intended use of the appraisal.
Passage 2: More often, a steering wheel that shakes when braking is caused by warped rotors, which your mechanic may be able to diagnose with a simple test -- that is, by spinning the rotors by hand to feel for imperfections.
Passage 3: Warping of older brakes usually leads to uneven force distribution around the brake plates when the brakes are applied. This results in vibration of the wheel, which is then transmitted to the rest of the car. The severity of the vibration depends on the severity of the brake pad warping. Pads that are severely worn out tend to make the car vibrate when brakes are applied when driving slowly, but less severe warping is only noticeable when the brakes are applied while the car is moving fast.
Passage 4: The first step in finding a solution for a steering wheel that vibrates during braking is to determine the cause of the shaking. As we mentioned, this is almost always caused by a problem with the rotors. Other causes of a vibrating steering system would generally cause shaking all the time, not just when braking. With that in mind, we'll focus this section on the most common rotor problems and their solutions.

Query: poly or mono for high temperature areas
Passage 1: 1 Due to tighter spacing of the cells on Multi / poly crystalline solar panels compared to mono crystalline solar panels the higher efficiency of mono crystalline solar panels is negligible. 2  Multi / poly crystalline solar panels tend to perform slightly better at high temperatures than mono crystalline solar panels. Mono crystalline solar cells are slightly more efficient than poly / multi crystalline solar cells. 2  Poly / multi crystalline solar panels are slightly cheaper to manufacture than mono crystalline solar panels.
Passage 2: The mono-crystalline panels are made out of cells from pure silicon. The difference between mono-crystalline and poly-crystalline solar cells is simply that Mono is produced from a single crystal of silicon whilst Poly is produced from a piece of silicon consisting of many crystals.Mono Panels take more time to manufacture and this is reflected on the price.his also means that the Poly Modules absorb slightly less solar energy and produce slightly less electricity, hence the cheaper price. Mono-crystalline solar panels will typically have higher efficiency rates (15-20%), converting energy particularly well in low-light conditions.
Passage 3: nan
Passage 4: If you compare the standard mono and poly products (code 6/60 models), you can see the range of peak power output runs from 250 to 270Wp for the mono panel and from 245 to 265Wp for the poly panel.The difference is 5Wp, or 2% less power for the polycrystalline.t also means that you can squeeze more energy out of situations where the area to place the panels is limited or expensive.

Passage 2: A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA sequence of a gene.   There are two ways in which a DNA mutation can occur:   1) Mutations can be inherited.This means … that if a parent has a mutation in his or her DNA, then the mutation is passed on to his or her children.   2) Mutations can be acquired.or example, this can happen during crossover during the formation of gametes. Substitution mutations happen when one nucleotide (the smallest unit of DNA) is replaced by another. These are caused by a number of chemicals that look like something in between both of those nucleotides.
Passage 3: Recent Examples of acre from the Web. 1  Which is why this new build homestay-style retreat on a 168 acre vineyard is so refreshing. 2  With the Johnson Controls Hall of Fame Village, the Hall of Fame’s campus will double to 200 acres and include a number of features that are consistent with other sports-focused mixed-use projects.
Passage 4: Three ways mutations can occur in genes are: 1. Insertion: Extra DNA nucleoties are added to the DNA strand. 2. Deletion: DNA nucleotides are deleted, therefore, changing the … DNA sequence. 3. Translocation: parts of chromosomes are exchanged.or example, this can happen during crossover during the formation of gametes. Substitution mutations happen when one nucleotide (the smallest unit of DNA) is replaced by another. These are caused by a number of chemicals that look like something in between both of those nucleotides.

Query: how airplane contains air pressure
Passage 1: Back on Earth, as elevation increases, the number of molecules decreases and the density of air therefore is less, meaning a decrease in air pressure. In fact, while the atmosphere extends more than 15 miles (24 km) up, one half of the air molecules in the atmosphere are contained within the first 18,000 feet (5.6 km).
Passage 2: No, your period does not stop when you go swimming.

When you get out of the water you will get a blood stain and be very embarrassed.
Passage 3: Although aircraft cabins are pressurized, cabin air pressure at cruising altitude is lower than air pressure at sea level. At typical cruising altitudes in the range 11 000–12 200 m (36 000–40 000 feet), air pressure in the cabin is equivalent to the outside air pressure at 1800–2400 m (6000–8000 feet) above sea level. As a consequence, less oxygen is taken up by the blood (hypoxia) and gases within the body expand.
Passage 4: Air Pressure can be defined as the pressure of air in the earths atmosphere. 100,000 Pa near sea level and decreases as altitude increases. More simply, it is the force exerted by the weight of the air. Even though air molecules are invisible, they still have mass and take up space.

Passage 5: Hyperthyroidism is a disorder in which the thyroid gland makes and releases more thyroid hormone than the body needs. Your doctor may say you have an  overactive thyroid  or refer to the condition as overactive thyroid disease..Your thyroid gland is located in the front of your neck.Hormones released by the thyroid affect nearly every part of your body from your brain to your skin and muscles. They play a crucial role in controlling how your body uses energy, a process called metabolism.he most common cause of hyperthyroidism is an autoimmune condition called Graves' disease. The body's immune system creates an antibody that causes the gland to make an excessive amount of thyroid hormone. Graves' disease runs in families and usually affects younger women.

Query: how does elevation affect tire pressure
Passage 1: Atmospheric pressure is the force per unit area exerted on a surface by the weight of air above that surface in the atmosphere of Earth (or that of another planet). In most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point.
Passage 2: Air has weight, and weight means pressure. The higher up you go, the less air left above to press down --and so, less pressure. Air Pressure decreases with the rise of altitude and increases when lowered. Example: You would not be able to breathe as well high in the air as you would standing on the ground.
Passage 3: nan
Passage 4: Cash dividends or other distributions of cash must be reported to the Exchange on the Notification: Cash Dividend/Distribution. Change in par value must be reported on the Notification: Change in Company Record.
Passage 5: The Influence of Altitude Changes on Tire Pressure. Significant changes in altitude affects tire pressures when traveling from one elevation to another. Fortunately, this influence is relatively small and can be easily accommodated. Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted on objects by the weight of the air molecules above them. While air molecules are invisible, they have mass and occupy space.

Passage 1: Nuclear power can generate electricity without greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are concerns about its safety. Learn about the safety and health concerns associated with the threat of nuclear meltdowns, as well as the challenges involved in storing radioactive waste.he isotope U-235 is important because it can be used in the nuclear fission chain reaction to create a lot of energy. Unlike the uranium used in a nuclear bomb, which is about 90% enriched with the isotope U-235, the uranium used in a nuclear reactor is only slightly enriched, to about four or five percent.
Passage 2: The actual risk depends on several factors: 1  The specific radioactive materials, or isotopes, released, and the quantities released. 2  How a person comes into contact with the released radioactive materials (such as through contaminated food, water, air, or on the skin).n the most severe kinds of accidents, such as the Chernobyl accident in 1986, other dangerous radioactive isotopes, such as strontium-90 (Sr-90) and plutonium-239, may also be released. Human exposure to I-131 released from nuclear power plant accidents comes mainly from consuming contaminated water, milk, or foods.

Passage 4: Gene Therapy. Gene therapy is a rapidly evolving form of molecular medicine with the potential to provide new treatments for inherited and acquired life-threatening rare diseases. When a gene is damaged, the blueprint for the construction of the protein it codes for is flawed, resulting in an abnormal protein and a genetic disease. The goal of gene therapy is to cure or slowdown a genetic disease by repairing the damaged gene responsible for the disease.
Passage 5: How does gene therapy work? Gene therapy is designed to introduce genetic material into cells to compensate for abnormal genes or to make a beneficial protein. If a mutated gene causes a necessary protein to be faulty or missing, gene therapy may be able to introduce a normal copy of the gene to restore the function of the protein. A gene that is inserted directly into a cell usually does not function.

Passage 3: Swelling in one or both legs are symptoms of a blood clot. Swelling that is a symptom of a blood clot in the leg can be sudden or chronic. A blood clot in the leg might produce no symptoms at all unless the clot dislodges and travels to another part of the body and blocks blood flow. A blood clot that travels through the leg veins to the lungs can kill within a matter of hours, warns the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.
Passage 4: Pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot gets lodged in an artery in the lung, blocking blood flow to part of the lung. Blood clots most often originate in the legs and travel up through the right side of the heart and into the lungs.

Passage 2: The answer is insulin.

It does this by both promoting uptake of glucose by cells and the storage of glucose within our cells.
Passage 3: In type 1 diabetes the immune system erroneously attacks the beta cells that produce insulin in your pancreas. It causes permanent damage, leaving your pancreas unable to produce insulin. Exactly what triggers the immune system to do that isn’t clear. Genetic and environmental factors may play a role.
Passage 4: Insulin is a relatively small peptide hormone produced by β-cells in the pancreas. It’s main job is to signal the liver, muscle and fat tissues to take up glucose from the blood and store it as glycogen. As the glucose level in the blood drops to normal, insulin release slows or stops.

Query: what causes pilonidal cysts
Passage 1: The Cabinet includes the Vice President and the heads of 15 executive departments — the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Attorney General.
Passage 2: The 210 calories in one serving of Culver's Corn Dog are equivalent to the calories burned while: Running (6 mph) for 17 minutes Stationary rowing for 36 minutes
Passage 3: 8 Signs and Symptoms of Pilonidal Cysts. Pilonidal cysts are the chronic and painful result of pilonidal sinus disease (PSD), which often plagues young males. The condition causes small cysts or abscess to persistently form and fill with pus, hair, infection, and blood when infected, and omit a foul smell until lanced and drained. Even though the exact cause of a pilonidal cyst is unknown, the abscesses will remain dormant until infection or flare-ups occur.
Passage 4: A pilonidal cyst is a small sac under the skin. Pilonidal cysts may become infected and cause an abscess (collection of pus). Pilonidal cysts may be caused by an ingrown hair. A hair may become ingrown if it rubs against your skin. The friction can cause hair to dig into the skin and get trapped there. A pilonidal cyst may look like a small hole or dimple in the center of your lower back. It is usually located right above your buttocks.
Passage 5: One proposed cause of pilonidal cysts is ingrown hair. Excessive sitting is thought to predispose people to the condition, as sitting increases pressure on the coccygeal region. Trauma is not believed to cause a pilonidal cyst; however, such an event may result in inflammation of an existing cyst.

Passage 2: Confusion: Ketosis vs Ketoacidosis - A dangerous condition called ketoacidosis can develop in those with type 1 diabetes, and it is sometimes confused with normal ketosis. The body usually avoids this state by producing insulin, but people with type 1 diabetes are unable to produce insulin.
Passage 3: What is Ketosis. Ketosis occurs in the body when a consistently low level of carbohydrates depletes liver glycogen and the body burns fatty acids for fuel, which create ketones as a byproduct. Ketones are a source of fuel, just as glucose is a source of a fuel. Think of it as flipping a switch in your body to pure fat-burning-for-fuel mode.

Query: life vs death cost

In reality, the death penalty’s complexity, length, and finality drive costs through the roof, making it much more expensive.

Passage 2: A Seattle University study examining the costs of the death penalty in Washington found that each death penalty case cost an average of $1 million more than a similar case where the death penalty was not sought ($3.07 million, versus $2.01 million).ccording to state and federal records obtained by The Los Angeles Times, maintaining the California death penalty system costs taxpayers more than $114 million a year beyond the cost of simply keeping the convicts locked up for life.
