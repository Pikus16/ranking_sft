Query: how long to smother a wart with tape
Passage 1: Tape occlusion is an inexpensive method of wart removal that involves covering the wart with tape. It is often called the duct tape method. Cut a piece of duct tape as close to the size of the wart as possible. Leave the tape in place for 6 days. If the tape falls off, put on a new piece.

Query: is acromegaly a tumor
Passage 1: Growth Hormone (GH) - The pituitary releases GH in short spurts throughout the day and night, resulting in constantly varying GH levels. When a person has acromegaly, abnormally high levels of GH are released by the pituitary. Too much GH causes changes in physical characteristics and other aspects of your body.
Passage 2: Acromegaly is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumor in the pituitary gland called a pituitary adenoma. The tumor produces too much GH and raises the level of GH in the blood. Too much GH also raises the level of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone produced in the liver that also promotes growth. Rarely, acromegaly is caused by hormone-producing tumors in other parts of the body.
Passage 3: The most common cause is a benign tumor in your pituitary gland, which is located under your brain. This tumor is not cancer. Because of the tumor, your body makes too much growth hormone. Once in a while, tumors in the pancreas, liver, or parts of the brain can cause high levels of growth hormone. That leads to higher levels of another hormone, called insulin-like growth hormone, which causes the symptoms you see.

Passage 3: October 13, 2012 By Keith Foskett 2 Comments. There’s been a lot of chatter on the web this week about the possibility of bikes being allowed on the Pacific Crest Trail. As it stands, the trail is for the use of hikers and equestrians only. Apparently the US Forestry Service has been approached asking to review its regulation of not allowing bikes on the trail.
Passage 4: However, another important consideration is MCAT score expiration. Medical schools unfortunately do not accept MCAT scores that are too old. The actual rule depends on the school but two to three years is the norm for most medical schools. There are also some differences between the old and the new MCAT. The best way to figure out your MCAT score expiration is to read the medical school policies for accepting scores.

Passage 2: The first step in finding a solution for a steering wheel that vibrates during braking is to determine the cause of the shaking.

With that in mind, we'll focus this section on the most common rotor problems and their solutions.
Passage 3: There are many front-end problems that can cause your steering wheel to shake when traveling at certain speeds. However, if the steering wheel shimmy only happens when applying the brake pedal, the possible causes are narrowed down quite a bit!

Passage 4: Two major coronary arteries branch off from the aorta near the point where the aorta and the left ventricle meet: 1  Right coronary artery supplies the right atrium and right ventricle with blood. 2  Left main coronary artery branches into the circumflex artery and the left anterior descending artery.
Passage 5: Warping of older brakes usually leads to uneven force distribution around the brake plates when the brakes are applied. This results in vibration of the wheel, which is then transmitted to the rest of the car. The severity of the vibration depends on the severity of the brake pad warping. Pads that are severely worn out tend to make the car vibrate when brakes are applied when driving slowly, but less severe warping is only noticeable when the brakes are applied while the car is moving fast.

Query: difference between dandruff and lice
Passage 1: These are called nits and are eggs of lice that are laid by female lice. These eggs become young adults in a few weeks after being laid and start sucking the blood from the scalp of the victim. This article attempts to highlight the differences between dandruff and nits to decide on the course of treatment.
Passage 2: Head Lice vs. Dandruff: How to Tell the Difference. Head lice and dandruff are two completely different things, yet people often mistake one for the other. Head lice are parasites that feed on human blood, and are spread through contact with others. Their bites cause an itchy scalp and occasionally an allergic reaction. Dandruff is a skin condition on the scalp that causes flaking of the skin and a slightly itchy scalp. Here's how to tell the difference between the two. Head lice are small, brown parasites with six legs about the size of a sesame seed. They have elongated bodies, with small, oval shaped heads.
Passage 3: When you look at your child’s head, you see some white flecks the size of a sesame seed: are they nits, or are they just dandruff or hair debris? The main difference between head lice eggs and dandruff is that lice eggs are glued to the hair shaft; they are firmly attached to the hair, and are not easily removed. On the contrary, dandruff is not attached to the hair and can be easily brushed off. 1  Dandruff is a common form of skin eczema, also called Seborrheic dermatitis.  Lice eggs are like white to yellowish dots on your hair, the size of a sesame seed.
Passage 4: Nits are lice eggs that need to be combed out of hair. Both nits and dandruff cause itching of the scalp, but the similarities stop there. The causes of nits and dandruff, as well as the treatments to treat these conditions are vastly different. Nits are the eggs of lice.
Passage 5: Knowing the difference between lice and dandruff can help heal your scalp condition properly. Lice are infectious parasites and dandruff is a self-contained scalp condition. Dandruff comes from the head, and flakes off. Dandruff is due to the excessive shedding of dead skin cells from the scalp, and lice are wingless insects (small bugs) that infest the hair and scalp. The methods of prevention and treatment also vary between lice and dandruff.

Query: does dehydration cause sleep harder
Passage 1: One of the signs of dehydration is tiredness. So if you’re chronically tired, drink water instead of a cup of coffee or other stimulant.

Ridges of muscle tissue called rugae line the stomach. The stomach muscles contract periodically, churning food to enhance digestion. The pyloric sphincter is a muscular valve that opens to allow food to pass from the stomach to the small intestine.

Query: how high does a satellite need to be to maintain orbit
Passage 1: The semi-synchronous orbit is a near-circular orbit (low eccentricity) 26,560 kilometers from the center of the Earth (about 20,200 kilometers above the surface). A satellite at this height takes 12 hours to complete an orbit.his special, high Earth orbit is called geosynchronous. A satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit directly over the equator (eccentricity and inclination at zero) will have a geostationary orbit that does not move at all relative to the ground. It is always directly over the same place on the Earth’s surface.
Passage 2: injunction definition A court order that either compels or restrains an act by an individual, organization, or government official. In labor–management relations, injunctions have been used to prevent workers from going on strike.
Passage 3: High Earth Orbit. When a satellite reaches exactly 42,164 kilometers from the center of the Earth (about 36,000 kilometers from Earth’s surface), it enters a sort of “sweet spot” in which its orbit matches Earth’s rotation.his special, high Earth orbit is called geosynchronous. A satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit directly over the equator (eccentricity and inclination at zero) will have a geostationary orbit that does not move at all relative to the ground. It is always directly over the same place on the Earth’s surface.
Passage 4: The actual satellite orbit that is chosen will depend on factors including its function, and the area it is to serve. In some instances the satellite orbit may be as low as 100 miles (160 km) for a Low Earth Orbit LEO, whereas others may be over 22 000 miles (36000 km) high as in the case of a GEostationary Orbit GEO.or a very low orbit of around 100 miles a velocity of about 17500 miles per hour is needed and this means that the satellite will orbit the Earth in about 90 minutes. At an altitude of 22 000 miles a velocity of just less than 7000 miles per hour is needed giving an orbit time of about 24 hours.
